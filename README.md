# Why this?

The Shadow cloud-computing application by Blade (https://shadow.tech) is available for Ubuntu 18.04. This repository extends compatibility to additional distributions and hardwares, providing scripts and documentation. The usefulness of this repository decreases during time as Blade improves its compatibility and fixes bugs. Still, this repository provides great documentations made by the community!

A sexy website is available ans summarizes everything on this git: https://nicolasguilloux.github.io/blade-shadow-beta/

# Disclaimer

This Github is *NOT* official. It was created by regular users only to centralize scripts and reports. As this Github is not affiliated with the Blade company, no Shadow developper has to answer the issues and therefore, don't expect any quick response. The goal is to provide a support about what we know, and gather as much information as possible to help people.

That being said, there is no reason what so ever to complain about Shadow or Blade in general on this Github. This is not the place and it is not appropriate as we don't work for them. To complain about something, please use the official Discords where you will get an official response.

Moreover, we expect respect when talking to each other. We all are regular users, and we are all looking for some help or to help. To learn more about what we expect, please our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).



## VA Drivers

The Shadow application requires your machine to support hardware decoding for H.264 or H.265, it will not work with software decoding. You can check whether hardware decoding is enabled by installing `vainfo` (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian) or `libva-utils` (Arch, Solus) from the repository of your distribution, and then running `vainfo` in the terminal. If "H264" or "HEVC" show up in the output, you are good to go. Otherwise, you probably need drivers for VAAPI, or your hardware is outdated. Several options are available based on your GPU, please use the following documentation to enable hardware decoding on your machine:

- Debian based: https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/vaapi
- Arch Linux: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Hardware_video_acceleration#Installing_VA-API

#### For most cases:

If your active GPU is an Intel chipset and you have no dedicated GPU, you will need the i965 Intel driver.
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install i965-va-driver`
- Arch Linx: `sudo pacman -S libva-intel-driver`
- Solus: `sudo eopkg it libva-intel-driver`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install libva-intel-hybrid-driver`

For NVIDIA users, you have 2 options:
- Use the Nouveau driver and install the old [NVIDIA firmware](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nouveau-fw) that provides support for the VA API.
- Use the [Arekinath patch](https://gitlab.com/aar642/libva-vdpau-driver) to provides VA API compatibility for recent NVIDIA cards.

In both cases, we strongly recommend you to follow this link: https://gitlab.com/aar642/shadowos-boot#support

#### For other cases:

If you still experience issues, more information are available on the [website](https://nicolasguilloux.github.io/blade-shadow-beta/#vainfo). Moreover, contact the Linux community on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/shadowtech) to get some help.


## AppImage

Shadow built an AppImage that should work on most recent distributions (> 2017). If you find any bug, please report it on the Discord or [create an issue](https://github.com/NicolasGuilloux/blade-shadow-beta/issues/new).

The AppImage embeds Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) libs and the official Shadow Beta application. However, it still requires a **working libVA** on your system and a **compatible GLIBC**.

To use the AppImage, [download the AppImage](https://nicolasguilloux.github.io/blade-shadow-beta/#appimage) to the folder you want, make it executable with `chmod a+x Shadow*.AppImage` and run it. 

## The AUR package

The AUR package [shadow-beta](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shadow-beta/) available for all Arch Linux based distribution was initially created by **agentcobra#6142** and now also maintained by **Nover#9563**. It is a quick way to install Shadow on the machine and get the updates frequently with the system updates.

To build it locally, download the git files from the AUR website and build the package by executing `makepkg`.

## NixOS

**Elyhaka** built a NixOS package for Shadow. [Check out his repository](https://github.com/Elyhaka/shadow-nix).


# Other configuration


### Fedora

Make sure you installed `librtmp` from RMP Fusion. Checkout the issue [#49](https://github.com/NicolasGuilloux/blade-shadow-beta/issues/49).
